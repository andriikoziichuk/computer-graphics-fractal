# PyNewtonFractal
Visualisation of the fractal that arises from Newton's method in the complex plane

## Usage
Use `PyNewtFrac_user.py`; set the resolution, the starting point `x0`, the function `f` and its first derivative `f1`.

When the program is "waiting for input", you can either:
- press `W` to zoom in
- press `S` to zoom out
- press `C` to change the colours, in case you don't like them
